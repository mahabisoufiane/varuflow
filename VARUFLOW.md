# Varuflow — Complete Project Documentation

## What Is Varuflow?

Varuflow is a **B2B SaaS platform for Nordic wholesalers**, targeting small-to-medium Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish wholesale businesses. It replaces fragmented tools (spreadsheets, separate invoicing apps, manual stock tracking) with a single integrated system covering inventory, invoicing, analytics, POS, and AI-driven business intelligence.

The target customer is a Nordic wholesale operator who buys goods from suppliers, stores them in warehouses, and sells them to business customers on credit terms (invoices with net-30/60 payment).

## Module-by-Module Breakdown

### 1. Authentication & Multi-tenancy

**How it works:**
- Users sign up / log in via Supabase Auth (email + password or magic link)
- Each user belongs to an **Organisation** — all data is scoped by `org_id`
- The FastAPI middleware validates the Supabase JWT on every request and extracts `org_id` from the user's profile
- After sign-up, users go through an **onboarding flow** that creates their organisation and sets a default locale (sv/no/da/en)
- Team members can be invited; roles are stored in the `OrganisationMember` table

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/middleware/auth.py` — JWT validation, org resolution
- `backend/app/routers/auth.py` — profile creation, org setup
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/auth/` — login, signup pages
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/onboarding/` — post-signup org creation

---

### 2. Inventory Management

The inventory system tracks products across multiple warehouses with full movement history.

**Products:**
- Each product has: name, SKU, barcode, purchase price (cost), sell price, category, VAT rate, minimum stock threshold, and supplier
- Products can be searched by name or barcode
- Product detail page shows current stock levels per warehouse and full movement history

**Warehouses:**
- Organisations can have multiple warehouses (e.g. "Main Warehouse Stockholm", "Distribution Oslo")
- Stock levels are tracked per product-per-warehouse combination

**Stock Movements:**
- Every stock change is recorded as a movement with type: `IN` (received), `OUT` (sold/dispatched), or `TRANSFER`
- Movements feed the AI engine's velocity calculations
- The movements list is filterable by type, product, and date

**Purchase Orders:**
- Create POs to suppliers with line items
- PO statuses: DRAFT → SENT → RECEIVED
- Receiving a PO automatically creates `IN` stock movements
- Norwegian EHF XML and Peppol BIS XML export for electronic procurement

**Suppliers:**
- Supplier directory with contact info, payment terms, and lead time
- Linked to products (each product has a primary supplier)

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/models/inventory.py` — Product, Warehouse, StockLevel, StockMovement, Supplier, PurchaseOrder models
- `backend/app/routers/inventory.py` — all CRUD + stock movement endpoints
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/(app)/inventory/` — all inventory pages

---

### 3. Invoicing

Full invoicing workflow from draft to payment collection.

**Invoice lifecycle:**
```
DRAFT → SENT → PAID
              ↓
           OVERDUE (auto-detected when due_date < today)
```

**Features:**
- Create invoices with line items (product, quantity, unit price, VAT)
- Auto-calculates subtotal, VAT (25% Swedish standard), and total in SEK
- Invoice number is auto-generated per organisation (INV-0001, INV-0002…)
- PDF generation via ReportLab — downloadable from the invoice detail page
- Email delivery via Resend — sends invoice PDF to customer
- **Stripe payment links** — generate a hosted Stripe Checkout page and attach the link to the invoice; customers can pay by card; webhook marks invoice as PAID on success
- **Norwegian EHF Billing 3.0 XML export** — for Norwegian customers requiring electronic invoicing via Peppol network (scheme 0192, NOK currency)
- **Overdue reminders** — automated email reminders with urgency copy (1st reminder vs 2nd reminder tone), optional Stripe pay-now button embedded

**Payments:**
- Manual payment recording (bank transfer, cash, etc.)
- Stripe webhook auto-recording for card payments
- Payment history per invoice

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/models/invoicing.py` — Invoice, InvoiceLineItem, Payment, Customer models
- `backend/app/routers/invoicing.py` — CRUD, PDF, email, EHF XML, Stripe payment link endpoints
- `backend/app/services/pdf_generator.py` — ReportLab PDF template
- `backend/app/services/email.py` — Resend email functions
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/(app)/invoices/` — invoice list, detail, new invoice pages

---

### 4. Recurring Invoices

Automate repeat billing for customers on subscription-like contracts.

**How it works:**
- Define a recurring template: customer, line items, frequency (weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly), start date, optional end date
- The system generates the next invoice automatically based on the schedule
- Templates can be paused or cancelled

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/routers/recurring.py`
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/(app)/recurring/page.tsx`

---

### 5. Customers (CRM)

Simple B2B customer directory.

- Company name, contact person, email, phone, address, org number
- Customer portal access management (magic link issuance)
- Customer history: all invoices, total invoiced, average payment time
- Customer detail page shows LTV (lifetime value) and invoice history

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/routers/invoicing.py` (customers are part of invoicing domain)
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/(app)/customers/page.tsx`

---

### 6. B2B Customer Portal

A separate self-service portal for **customers** (buyers) — not internal users.

**How it works:**
1. Internal user sends a magic link to a customer's email via the customer page
2. Customer clicks the link → hits `/portal/auth/verify?token=xxx`
3. Backend validates the one-time token, issues a **portal JWT** (separate from Supabase auth, HS256 signed with `PORTAL_JWT_SECRET`, includes `type: "portal"` claim to prevent reuse as internal token)
4. Customer is redirected to their invoice list at `/portal/invoices`
5. Portal shows only invoices for that specific customer (scoped by `customer_id` + `org_id`)
6. Customers can download PDF invoices and click Stripe "Pay now" buttons

**Dev mode:** When Resend is not configured, the magic link URL is returned in the API response body for testing without email.

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/routers/portal.py` — magic link issue, token verify, portal-scoped invoice endpoints
- `backend/app/models/invoicing.py` — `CustomerPortalToken` model
- `frontend/src/app/portal/` — standalone portal app (separate layout, no AppShell)
- `frontend/src/lib/portal-client.ts` — portal API client using localStorage JWT

---

### 7. Point of Sale (POS / Cash Register)

A simple in-store cash register for walk-in sales.

**How it works:**
- Barcode scanner support (camera or USB HID)
- Add products to cart by scanning or searching
- Apply discounts per line
- Complete sale → auto-creates OUT stock movements and records the transaction
- Receipt printing support
- Session-based: open/close cash register sessions with opening float

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/models/pos.py` — PosSession, PosTransaction models
- `backend/app/routers/pos.py`
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/(app)/pos/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/app/BarcodeScanner.tsx` — camera-based barcode scanner component

---

### 8. Analytics

Business intelligence dashboard with date-range filtering and PDF export.

**Metrics available:**
- Revenue over time (invoiced vs collected) — area chart by month
- Top 5 customers by revenue — bar chart
- Top 5 products by revenue — horizontal bar chart
- Invoice status breakdown — pie chart (DRAFT / SENT / PAID / OVERDUE counts)
- All charts respect `from_date` / `to_date` query params

**PDF Export:**
- ReportLab generates a multi-page analytics report
- Includes the same metrics as the screen in printable format

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/routers/analytics.py` — overview endpoint + PDF export
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/(app)/analytics/page.tsx`

---

### 9. AI Intelligence Engine

Two-part AI system: proactive action cards + reactive chat advisor.

#### Part A: AI Action Cards (Rules-based, no LLM cost)

The backend runs 5 analytical modules every time `GET /api/ai/cards` is called. No OpenAI calls — pure SQL + Python logic.

| Module | What it detects | How |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| 1. Stockout Risk | Products running out soon | SUM(OUT movements last 7 days) / 7 = daily velocity → days_until_empty vs lead time (5 days) |
| 2. Margin Leak | Products with low gross margin | (sell_price - purchase_price) / sell_price vs category benchmark; flagged if < 75% of benchmark |
| 3. Dead Stock | Products with no sales movement | No OUT movements in last 30 days |
| 4. (reserved) | — | — |
| 5. Overdue + Churn Risk | Customers who haven't paid or haven't ordered recently | Overdue by age bucket (30/60/90+ days); churn flag if LTV > 5,000 SEK and no invoice in 45 days |

Each card has: `module`, `severity` (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), `title`, `body`, `suggested_action`, and an `action_type` (`SEND_REMINDER` or `DRAFT_PO`).

**Actionable buttons on each card:**
- `SEND_REMINDER` → calls `POST /api/ai/actions/send-reminder` → triggers overdue reminder email via Resend
- `DRAFT_PO` → calls `POST /api/ai/actions/draft-po` → auto-creates a Purchase Order for the product's primary supplier

Cards are shown on the dashboard and on the dedicated `/ai` page (with module filter bar, KPI summary row, expandable detail view).

#### Part B: AI Chat Advisor (GPT-4o)

A floating chat panel (bottom-right of every app page) powered by OpenAI GPT-4o.

**System prompt structure:** The advisor follows a DETECT → DIAGNOSE → PRESCRIBE framework across 5 domains:
1. Inventory & Supply Chain
2. Cash Flow & Receivables
3. Pricing & Margin
4. Customer Behaviour & Churn
5. Operational Efficiency

**Guardrails:**
- Only answers questions about the user's wholesale business
- Responds in the same language the user writes in (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, or English)
- Will not give legal/tax/financial advice
- Chat history is stored in `localStorage` (no server-side history)

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/routers/ai_engine.py` — rules engine, action endpoints
- `backend/app/routers/integrations.py` — `/api/integrations/chat` GPT-4o endpoint
- `frontend/src/components/app/AiActionCards.tsx` — dashboard widget
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/(app)/ai/page.tsx` — full AI advisor page
- `frontend/src/components/app/AiChat.tsx` — floating chat panel

---

### 10. Internationalisation (i18n)

Full 4-locale support built into the routing layer.

| Locale | Language | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `en` | English | Default fallback |
| `sv` | Swedish | Primary market, SEK currency |
| `no` | Norwegian Bokmål | NOK currency, EHF invoicing |
| `da` | Danish | DKK currency |

- URL structure: `/en/dashboard`, `/sv/dashboard`, `/no/dashboard`, `/da/dashboard`
- Locale switcher in the sidebar footer (EN / SV / NO / DA buttons)
- Norwegian locale enables EHF XML export button on invoices
- Translation files: `frontend/messages/{en,sv,no,da}.json`

**Key files:**
- `frontend/src/i18n/routing.ts` — locale list and default
- `frontend/src/i18n/request.ts` — server-side locale resolution
- `frontend/src/middleware.ts` — locale prefix middleware (excludes `/portal` paths)

---

### 11. Progressive Web App (PWA)

Varuflow installs as a native-like app on mobile and desktop.

- `public/manifest.json` — app name, icons, `display: standalone`, `start_url: /dashboard`, theme `#1a2332`
- `public/sw.js` — custom service worker (no next-pwa dependency):
  - **Precache** app shell on install
  - **Navigation requests** → network-first (always fresh HTML)
  - **Static assets** → cache-first (fast loads)
  - **API requests** → network-only (never serve stale data)
  - **Push notifications** — service worker listens for push events and shows notifications
- `PwaInstallBanner` component — shows install prompt when `beforeinstallprompt` fires
- Settings page has a "Notifications" tab to request push permission

---

### 12. Fortnox Integration

Connects to Fortnox (the dominant Swedish accounting ERP) via OAuth2.

- `GET /api/integrations/fortnox/auth` → redirects to Fortnox OAuth consent
- `GET /api/integrations/fortnox/callback` → exchanges code for access token, stores in org settings
- `GET /api/integrations/fortnox/status` → returns `{ connected: bool }`
- When connected, a green "FX" badge appears in the sidebar
- Invoices can be synced to Fortnox (creates Fortnox invoices from Varuflow invoices)

---

### 13. Billing (Stripe Subscriptions)

Varuflow's own SaaS subscription billing (separate from Stripe payment links used for customer invoices).

- `POST /api/billing/checkout` → creates a Stripe Checkout session for the org's subscription
- `POST /api/billing/webhook` → handles `customer.subscription.updated`, `invoice.paid` etc.
- `GET /api/billing/portal` → Stripe Customer Portal link for self-service plan management
- Plan enforcement gates features (e.g., AI features require Pro plan)

**Key files:**
- `backend/app/routers/billing.py`
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/(app)/settings/page.tsx` — billing tab

---

### 14. Settings

Organisation-wide configuration page with 5 tabs:

| Tab | What you can do |
|-----|----------------|
| **General** | Org name, address, org number, default currency, VAT number |
| **Team** | Invite members by email, manage roles, remove members |
| **Integrations** | Connect Fortnox, configure OpenAI key, configure Resend key |
| **Billing** | View current plan, upgrade/downgrade, manage payment method |
| **Notifications** | Enable/disable push notifications (requests browser permission) |
